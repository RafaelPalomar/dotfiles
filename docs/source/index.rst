Entelequia Dotfiles System
===========================

Welcome to the Entelequia documentation!

This is a **GNU Guix-based declarative dotfiles system** called "entelequia".
It manages complete system configurations for multiple machines (desktop and laptop)
using Guix's functional package management and home-environment system. The entire
system state is declared in Scheme code, making it fully reproducible.
